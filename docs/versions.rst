Version Numbers and Module Compatibility
========================================

DynaSched's version numbers are the union of several different values:
major, minor, release, and an optional quantifier.

* Major: The major number is the first integer in the version string
  (e.g., v1.2.3). Changes in the major number typically indicate a
  significant change in the code base and/or end-user
  functionality. The major number is always included in the version
  number. Module interfaces for existing plugins _may_ have changed in
  the new major release, though this isn't always the case.

* Minor: The minor number is the second integer in the version
  string (e.g., v1.2.3). Changes in the minor number typically
  indicate a incremental change in the code base and/or end-user
  functionality. The minor number is always included in the version
  number. Module interfaces for existing plugins remain stable,
  but new plugins may have been added.

* Release: The release number is the third integer in the version
  string (e.g., v1.2.3). Changes in the release number typically
  indicate a bug fix in the code base and/or end-user
  functionality. No changes to existing module interfaces, nor any
  new plugins for those modules, will have been introduced.

* Quantifier: DynaSched version numbers sometimes have an arbitrary
  string affixed to the end of the version number. Common strings
  include:

  * ``aX``: Indicates an alpha release. X is an integer indicating
    the number of the alpha release (e.g., v1.2.3a5 indicates the
    5th alpha release of version 1.2.3).
  * ``bX``: Indicates a beta release. X is an integer indicating
    the number of the beta release (e.g., v1.2.3b3 indicates the 3rd
    beta release of version 1.2.3).
  * ``rcX``: Indicates a release candidate. X is an integer
    indicating the number of the release candidate (e.g., v1.2.3rc4
    indicates the 4th release candidate of version 1.2.3).

Although the major, minor, and release values (and optional
quantifiers) are reported in DynaSched tarballs, the
filenames of these snapshot tarballs follow a slightly different
convention.

Specifically, the tarball filename contains three distinct
values:

* Most recent Git tag name on the branch from which the tarball was
  created.

* An integer indicating how many Git commits have occurred since
  that Git tag.

* The Git hash of the tip of the branch.

For example, a snapshot tarball filename of
``dynasched-v1.0.2-57-gb9f1fd9.tar.bz2`` indicates that this tarball was
created from the v1.0 branch, 57 Git commits after the ``v1.0.2`` tag,
specifically at Git hash gb9f1fd9.

DynaSched's Git master branch contains a single ``dev`` tag.  For example,
``dynasched-dev-8-gf21c349.tar.bz2`` represents a tarball created
from the master branch, 8 Git commits after the "dev" tag,
specifically at Git hash gf21c349.

The exact value of the "number of Git commits past a tag" integer is
fairly meaningless; its sole purpose is to provide an easy,
human-recognizable ordering for tarballs.
