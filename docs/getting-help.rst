Getting help
============

Found a bug?  Got a question?  Want to make a suggestion?  Want to
contribute to DynaSched?  Please let us know!

Many common questions about building and using DynaSched are answered
in these pages. However, if your question isn't answered here, then
questions and comments should generally be
posted to the `DynaSched GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/dynasched/dynasched/issues>`_.

When submitting questions and problems, be sure to include as much
extra information as possible.  The GitHub issue template details all the information that we
request in order to provide assistance.

Please keep in mind that DynaSched is a community of volunteers - while we
do our best to address issues in a timely manner, we cannot guarantee to
solve anyone's problem as fast as we would like.
